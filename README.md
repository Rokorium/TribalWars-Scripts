# TribalWars-Scripts
A collection of scripts for the game Tribal Wars to enahance gameplay and automate tasks.

## Scripts Included
- **Loot Enhancer** (Pending Approval): Originally created by ntoombs, and later fixed by Ibra Gonza II. I do not take credit for this script and all credits go to the original authors. This script enhances the looting experience by optimizing resource collection strategies.

## Future Plans
- Recreate other scripts to increase knowledge of scripting. 
- Recreate more abandoned scripts to enhance gameplay.
